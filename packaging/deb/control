Package: iputils99-ping
Provides: ping
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: iputils-ping
Architecture: any
Description: Tools to test the reachability of network hosts
 The ping command sends ICMP echo packets to a target host
 in order to test its reachability, and then measures round-trip time.
 Statistics plus a short resume are printed at exit.

Package: iputils99-arping
Provides: arping
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: iputils-ping, arping
Architecture: any
Description: Tool to send ICMP echo requests to an ARP address
  ARPing destination on device interface by ARP packets.
  arping supports IPv4 addresses only, see ndisc6(8) for IPv6.

Package: iputils99-clockdiff
Provides: clockdiff
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: iputils-clockdiff
Architecture: any
Description: Measure the time difference between networked computers
 Clockdiff measures clock difference with 1 msec resolution
 using ICMP TIMESTAMP packets or,
 optionally, IP TIMESTAMP option added to ICMP ECHO

Package: iputils99-tracepath
Provides: tracepath
Suggests: traceroute
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: iputils-tracepath
Architecture: any
Description: Tools to trace the network path to a remote host
 Tracepath traces the network path to destination discovering MTU
 along this path and using UDP for outgoing packets

Package: iputils99-gai
Provides: gai
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: Resolve names using getaddrinfo()
 Gai resolves names as if with the getaddrinfo(3) routine and
 prints them to standard output in ping-like way.
 It's handy to test ai_flags on different libc versions.
